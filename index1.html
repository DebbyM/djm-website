  <h1>Welcome.</h1>
  <p><img src="Images/DebbyRedSweater.jpg" width="180" height="191" alt="DebbyPhoto" /> My name is Debby Meredith. In 2003, after over two decades of being an entrepreneur, general manager, and venture capitalist, I began working on my own helping various companies to establish or enhance their development organizations. I've often taken on interim executive roles working directly with company founders, helping to assemble world-class teams, architecture software products, and establish an initial roadmap for operational success. It's been extremely rewarding for me to work with high caliber teams of committed entrepreneurs and hopefully helpful to the companies as well. In addition to my consulting, board, and advisory work, I'm currently a <a href="http://www.iconventures.com/team/">venture partner</a> with Icon Ventures. <a href="http://www.iconventures.com">Icon Ventures</a> is a venture capital firm seeking to invest in emerging technology-based companies.</p>
